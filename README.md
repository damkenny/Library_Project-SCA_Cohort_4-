# Library_Project-SCA_Cohort_4

I learned how to input the .js file and style.css file into my html file by using link and href

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="Style.css">

and        
         
     <script src="Script.js"></script>
     
 Also worked extensively on styling this project library website by adding stlye and color using my .css file.
